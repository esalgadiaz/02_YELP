# The aim of the project is to find out what could be the different locations to set up a company, especially in the franchise market and what could be the star ratings that could be given by different reviews found in different websites.

# Practice 3 structure:

Data: dataset.
HTML: EDA in html format.
Nootebooks: Jupyter notebook and environment.
References: Data dictionaries, manuals, etc.

# Structure of notebook:
Detailed steps:


- It is a dataset to train and validate prediction models using Machine learning, although in the first phase of the project, we will perform a general analysis of the dataset.

- In the second phase, we will make an analysis of different franchises selected previously, we will also perform different graphs and an analysis of the reviews that have been posted by the customers in the different franchises such as the most common words, and the most used positive and negative words in the reviews.

- In this last phase, we will make predictions using a neural network to predict the stars and we will also apply the shap library to perform the explainability.
